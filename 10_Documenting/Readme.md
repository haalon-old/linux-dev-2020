# I18nL10n

Do an out-of-source build with following commands:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make all
```

Use `make translate` to make a translation
Use `make man` to make a man-page from --help
Use `make docs` to make a doxygen documentation

To clean up - just remove the *build* directory
