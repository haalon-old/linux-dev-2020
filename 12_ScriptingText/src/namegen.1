The namegen program creates a name generator based on an input
pattern. The letters s, v, V, c, B, C, i, m, M, D, and d represent
different types of random replacements. Everything else is emitted
literally.
.TP
s
generic syllable
.TP
v
vowel
.TP
V
vowel or vowel combination
.TP
c
consonant
.TP
B
consonant or consonant combination suitable for beginning a word
.TP
C
consonant or consonant combination suitable anywhere in a word
.TP
i
insult
.TP
m
mushy name
.TP
M
mushy name ending
.TP
D
consonant suited for a stupid person's name
.TP
d
syllable suited for a stupid person's name (begins with a vowel)
.PP
All characters between parenthesis () are emitted literally. For
example, the pattern 's(dim)', emits a random generic syllable
followed by 'dim'.
.PP
Characters between angle brackets <> emit patterns from the table
above. Imagine the entire pattern is wrapped in one of these.
.PP
In both types of groupings, a vertical bar | denotes a random choice.
Empty groups are allowed. For example, '(foo|bar)' emits either 'foo'
or 'bar'. The pattern '<c|v|>' emits a constant, vowel, or nothing at
all.
.PP
An exclamation point ! means to capitalize the component that follows
it. For example, '!(foo)' will emit 'Foo' and 'v!s' will emit a
lowercase vowel followed by a capitalized syllable, like 'eRod'.
